## Introduction
Data wrangling in one of the important technique in data science. In this project I worked on different type of techniques can be used to clean data and analyze input data. It also helped me understand how we can automate our scripts for data processing. Also worked on different ways to acquire data and then process the data.

MF.py is the program which did webscrapping and saved the data in a dataset.
